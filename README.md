> The distribution binary is not an open source software in itself, since I had to sign it and didn't want others to be able to change what I had signed. However the app is only 5 lines of code so if you don't trust the binary, you can copy paste these fives lines into the Script Editor.app software and export it to an Application:

> ```applescript
> tell application "System Events"
>   tell appearance preferences
>	    set dark mode to not dark mode
>	  end tell
> end tell
> ```
