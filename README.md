## Not Open Source Per Say

The distribution binary is not an open source software in itself, since I had to sign it and didn't want others to be able to change what I had signed. However the app is only 5 lines of code so if you don't trust the binary, you can copy paste these fives lines into the Script Editor.app software and export it to an Application:

```applescript
tell application "System Events"
	tell appearance preferences
		set dark mode to not dark mode
	end tell
end tell
```
